## Builder Pattern

### Objective
Create a complex object by using an object builder that seperates construction from representation.

### Concept
BuilderImpl's implement the Builder interface which provides implementations of methods used to construct a complex object.

The Director class uses a Builder to orchestrate the construction and provide an interface for the client to construct and retrieve results.
